No showerin the upstairs ensuite so a little inconvenient to have to shower on the main floor when there is other people in the lounge area. Overall though a nice convenient location and we would use again.",

One bedroom downstairs has twin beds and the other bedroom is upstairs with a queen bed and full pullout bed in the couch. Bath and shower are on the main floor and there is an additional toilet and sink upstairs in the master bedroom. Three levels are stacked on top of each other, but it works well. We had a great time!  Floors on the main level are laminate, so tracking in snow is not a huge concern. \nThis place worked great for us!",

The place was clean, very quiet, spacious to stretch and relax.   \nKitchen was well stocked as well if you are planning on cooking your own meals.  Overall, we had a very comfortable stay.

The kitchen had everything we needed to cook a few meals. Sheila and her team made check in and out super easy, and I can’t recommend the spot enough. Perfect way to experience Fernie!",

It is so worn out and tired with scuffs and chips over the walls in the living area, the place was not clean with hairballs on the floor, the sofa had leather peeling off as you sit on it, there were random holes in the wall stuffed with tissue paper...need i go on! Oh yeah and the so called bbq on the patio was not usuable as the burners were rotten and had collapsed. It clearly hadnt been used in a long time as it was dirty and had leaves etc in it. It was not a nice outdoor space! Its a shame as we had just come from a gorgeous place we found on airbnb having had 5 nights there and which we gave a raving review, and then to come to this was a total let down. We checked out after 1 night and found something better.",

          "comment": "My family and I spent a weekend at Sheila's condo and found the space to be fine for our needs. We appreciated that it was clean and comfortable (the beds and pillows were great) but it is very basic, nothing fancy and looking a little worn (the leather sofa is very scuffed up). The bedrooms are huge while the living room and kitchen are very small. We would look for something roomier with more amenities and comforts if we were contemplating a longer stay. Make note... no dish cloth and tea towel provided, and we could not find a scouring pad for pots, a tea pot (always a bonus for us tea drinkers) or vegetable peeler. Many other kitchen tools are available but not those listed here. We enjoyed the location and Sheila was very pleasant to deal with.",

We were 10- and the sleeping arrangements could not have suited us better. From grandma having her own space to family with kids with room to breath & young adults getting their own beds. We cooked & BBQ'd our own meals- the kitchen was equipped well enough to get these large meals on the table without a hitch! The whole booking was easy in- easy out & at a great price.",

The coffee maker is old-style but fortunately there’s fresh ground coffee available 24x7 at the convenience store nearby. The upstairs (loft) beds are great but it’s a huge walk up the stairs and there’s no bathroom up there which makes it a challenge for late night bathroom visits. Also, bring soap and shampoo since the soap there isn’t good and there’s no hair products. Jennifer was super responsive and the check-in super easy! I recommend Jennifer’s place and would stay again!",

We had no problems or concerns.  It is set up a lot like a hotel room with 2 queen beds and a small bathroom, exactly as shown in the pictures.  It was all we needed.  The beds weren't the most comfortable but they were good enough (maybe just a matter of preference-they were not run down or old) and all the linens were of good quality.  There was some closet space and a small fridge and microwave that came in handy.",

A little chilly at times due to gusts under the door, but access to your own thermostat helped! Really enjoyed our stay, Jennifer was an absolute delightful from start to finish. Very understanding and went out of her way to accommodate when I (very stupidly) booked the wrong dates. Thanks again!",

We found it to be clean and fresh but, again, be sure to bring your own cutlery and plates as these are not supplied (we did find some plastic plates left in the drawer, but they were small and we try not to use disposables!). Nice view from the window, good proximity to nature. It is close to other units, so there was some noise from upstairs but only during the day; nights were quiet (except for the train, but you'd hear it anywhere in the valley!) Overall, a nice little place to stay during a visit to Fernie :)",

The bedroom is nice, and the bed very comfortable.\nThe location is nice, great view. The patio is nice to eat, you have the sun in the late morning and in the evening too.\nThere are fans in the home in case it's hot.\nYou can enjoy walking along the river too. \nGreat reactivity of the facility team when needed.",

Good location with beautiful views, easy check in and check out through the door code.\nNice place for weekend getawayin mountains. \nUnfortunately we were 3 adults staying there. Description says there is couch with hide in bed. First it's pretty small and I can't imagine 2 people sleeping on it.  Secondly the mattress is so thin you can feel every single spring and makes it impossible to sleep on it. I ended upsleeping on the floor as more comfortable and less hurtful option.",

The whole point (initially) with Airbnb was that it would be less expensive than a hotel. So, they have the owner price their space at $55/night and then there's a service fee and a cleaning fee and an admin fee, and a fee for climbing the stairs and a fee for using the lights and ...and...(a bit of hyperbole but you get my drift). \n\nBy the time all was said and done the ACTUAL cost was $86/night for a 5-night stay (for a nice place with a small fridge and mic). \n\nFor $80/night (taxes in and NO hidden fees) we could have stayed in a hotel with a fully stocked kitchenette. A hotel just simply tells you what the charge is PERIOD. \n\nIt's become way too much work - getting an apples to apples comparison. We thought we had done our homework - really disappointed in the final amount.\n\nThis is not an inditement on the place  - just on how airbnb gets owners to price is very misleading.",

It's situated at the end of a townhouse block, so on one side there is an entrance deck looking out toward an amazing mountain view.  The unit is on the second floor - neighbors above and below.  During our stay it was quiet.   It's a great value - particularly during a peak winter ski week.  The unit consists of a living room, bedroom and bathroom, although there is a hallway connecting all the rooms that is very handy for keeping bags and equipment - plus there is a lot of closet space.    There's a fridge and a microwave (bring your own plates and utensils).    My only complaint is that the foldout couch is extremely uncomfortable!",

The view from the deck is amazing with the cool crisp mountain air.  Check in was really easy and Jennifer is really quick to respond and offered her assistance if we needed anything.  We would definitely book here again.",

The deck has a coating and is not a wooden surface so it was quite slippery where it had been packed down and become icy.

Perfect location between town and the ski hill making it easy to spend time in either location without feeling 'stuck' on the hill or driving for too long to get to the ski hill. There are some stairs to get up to the unit outside, but they were always clear of snow and well lit after dark. Great space for a shorter stay and the fridge made it easy to bring a few groceries to make lunches!

It is ideally located, across the street from some of the top mountain biking trails in Fernie and possibly even all of the world! We had no issues with noise from adjoining units or noise outside. Great sleeps!\nWe would definitely rent this unit or others from Martin again in the future. The whole experience was as it should be for any Airbnb, totally seamless.",

          "comment": "Derek was easy to communicate with and the place was a quick trip to the hill. My boyfriend and I made a quick trip to spend a few days on the hill and it was a very reasonably priced place for us to spend our nights. Easy access and comfortable stay. Although it had a mini fridge and microwave, a coffee pot or kettle would have really added to the place for those early mornings to get to the hill. Would recommend for a couple just looking for a place to sleep rather then spend a whole lot of time in. Overall good experience for what we were looking for.",

This space is in a condo building with rules around parking anything resembling a camper van. We have a high roof cargo van that isn't even used as a camper van and management put a notice on our windshield.\n\nOne neighbour came up and angrily told us we were not permitted there and cut me off every time I tried to explain that we were paying guests. A few other neighbours glared at us simply because we drive a van.\n\nThe lock on the door died and we were locked out of the unit halfway through our stay. We asked for a refund because we couldn't get in, by no fault of our own. We were still charged for that night.\n\nOtherwise, the unit was very clean, the scenery is gorgeous, and the unit is sufficient if all you need is a place to sleep/shower without cooking.",

It would have been nice to have amenities like a hair dryer but again, not a massive deal.\n\nAll in all, a good stay in Fernie for the price.",

The location is fantastic and the nearby trails close to the river are fun to explore. The place is small, so if you have a lot of stuff, you will need to be intentional about staying organized. Otherwise it’s fantastic and a good value.",

The picture shown, is misleading. As we had planned on using those tables to cook lunch/dinner it was inconvenient. \n\n* The listing clearly states AC, and whilst this is technically “correct” we had no access to the control panel. Super misleading, and frustrating. If I had known prior to booking, I possible wouldn’t have booked. \n\n* Finally the “deck”, it is just the entry way to both accomodation listings, not suitable for sitting outside, as it’s quite small.",

The beds were comfy and the bath towels were so soft! \n\nThe kitchen space was a bit small, which we expected based on the photos, but it wasn't a problem for us. The kitchen was stocked with all the pots and pans that we needed including salt, pepper, olive oil, and sugar. \n\nGuy was very responsive and communication was great. Also, the self check-in/out process was so easy and fast. We really liked that!\n\nFantastic value for the price. We would certainly stay here again. Thank you Guy!",

The inside of the condo was well laid out, cozy, and has plenty of space for up to 4 people. Liam was fast at responding when we had issues turning on the fire place and helped us sort out the issue in short order. I would recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a place to stay in Fernie.",

Walls between the room and the main unit are quite thin, so you are able to hear talking, coughing, showering, etc. in the other room. We had to leave the room after two nights of our five night stay due to there being many bugs flying above the beds in the room during the night. The bugs were crawling all over the ceiling and beds, which made for a very uncomfortable stay. The host did nothing about our issue, and seemed not to care much. No refund or compensation for leaving early and having to deal with the bugs.",

Lodge guests were quiet at night had no issues with that. only thing I would recommend would be to bring a hot plate or microwave if your staying for a few weeks, i was left eating cold meals for 2 weeks as there was no microwave to heat food. Other then that it was a great stay!",

          "comment": "We sent Thomas a message regarding having an issue with our TV remote and we were told someone will come have take a look at it. Shortly after, we heard the lockpad on our door unlock itself and before the person had swung open, I opened the door and there was a man standing there stating we had trouble with our lock. I told him \"no we have a problem with our remote and can't get our TV to work\". The guy took the remote and brought it back stating he had changed the batteries. In the end, the TV never ended up working during our stay regardless of changing the batteries. We told Thomas about the TV not working and hopefully got it fixed for the next tenant. Our overall experience made us feel uneasy since the guy unlocked our door without knocking as common courtesy regardless if there was a tenant or not, and he did not apologize for doing so. It made my fiancé and I feel comfortable that there was no way to lock our door from the inside of our rental after what had happened. It was strange. And obviously the sense of trust was an issue now. In hindsight, the location of the place is optimal as it is walking distance from the ski hill.",

As it is a joined room we did hear the neighbor's dog barking while they were out so we were more mindful of any noise we made. Read the other reviews as they helped us a lot in packing - I recommend bringing cups, coffee/filters, and a fan since it does get a bit warm (also adds white noise). The beds were comfortable and room was very clean. There is a large smart TV on the wall (not in the pics) so you can use your Netflix, etc. We cooked on the BBQ which worked well - just bring your own cutlery, etc. The mini fridge worked well including the little freezer at the top. It took us a while to find the garbages but did on the last day by the property behind us. Quick walk to the ski hill and convenience store. Overall a great place to stay and we will be back!",

A small table fan has been added to the room which was great- helped with the warm evenings! Was a nice, basic, hotel like place to stay. I enjoyed the suite, had a microwave, fridge and a coffee pot, at a great nightly price. Also used the BBQ both nights which was ideal, as I love to BBQ! Bring all your own kitchen wear as there is none in the suite. Overall would recommend the place to others and would absolutely stay again!",

A closet offers plenty of room for storage, and with prior arrangement we offer garage space for skis, bikes, etc. There is a gas fire place which is especially useful in the winter and a dining area which can double up as a work space.<br><br>The deck and back yard is available to use and you can access the park through the back gate<br><br>When I'm home, I love to socialise with guests, but also understand when personal space is needed. I am available to answer any questions you may have.<br><br>An early morning stroll in the beautiful James White Park backing onto the property is the perfect way to sample our fresh clean air. Otherwise access the hiking/ biking or cross country ski trails from here, or take a quiet stroll into our cute mountain town where you may sample some delightful eateries or peruse the variety of stores which are especially enticing to outdoor enthusiasts.<br><br>We are about 20 to 30 minutes walk from the historical downtown which can be accessed by road or enjoy a walk along the trail, from the back garden. There is limited public transport in Fernie, so a car is useful, or many of the young skiiers hike to the hitching spot just outside city limits (30 minutes)<br><br>I normally live here but may not always be around during your stay. Ryan and Jen live in my basement suite, with their gorgeous and friendly dog, Haggis. They don't use the main house, but you may see or hear them from time to time, and they occasionally use their bbq on the deck outside your suite. There is also an Airbnb rental in the main part of the home.<br>For this reason it is important to respect the parking areas, and quiet time. There is a spot allocated to this space, facing the LEFT garage door as you face the house.",

Cheryl was quick to communicate, keeps her unit clean (sheets, towels, dishes all sparkling), and has a convenient location with easy access to the park behind, and in close proximity to downtown. Like most areas in Fernie, you will hear the train, but after a couple days you do adjust to it. \nIn our opinion the unit could use a little TLC, particularly the kitchen. The hot plates worked well, but if you plan to cook, bring your own oils, spices etc. The unit lacks good sound insulation, so we felt uncomfortable with how easy it was to hear all the conversations, foot steps, etc within the home. For a quick stay it may not be an issue for most people, but with a longer stay, we almost felt as though we had a bedroom in a house instead of a private suite, particularly because there is no TV to stay entertained in the evenings. \nAll in all, we had a good stay, enjoyed how clean the space was, and appreciated how easy it was to access the park behind.",

Also: lovely details like a locally made soap in the bathroom as well as coffee and tea in the kitchen.\nWould definitely come back!",

The unit is a section at the back of the house on the main floor which backs on to a very nice patio area, which gets lots of sun during the day. The space itself is very well done. It has everything you need and nothing you don't. You do hear people from the adjoining rooms from time to time. Nothing very loud, but I would recommend bringing a portable speaker so you have the option of playing some soft music. The location in town allows quick access to the bike trails. I rode everyday without using my car. Very good experience. Cheryl was very friendly and accommodating. Would stay there again.",

The walls and floors are very thin, though, and it's right next to a stairway, so we found it quite noisy with people walking around in ski boots. The view faces the parking lot and garbage area. We were surprised that the check out routine involved removing all the garbage and recycling from the room - especially given the hefty fee and cleaning fee paid. It was a decent accomodation, overall.",

The recommendation that AirBNB leaves is to treat the place like it's Your own.  I almost went straight to the hardware store to start repairs.\n\n1- security lock had been kicked off the back door\n2- Air Conditioning didn’t work (it was + 32) but it did leak all over the inside of the window sill\n3- the tub didn’t drain - I filled up during showers.  The shower curtain was too long, and was underfoot during showers.\n4- The tap water was so salty it was undrinkable\n5- cupboard doors were falling off\n6- blinds were broken\n7- screens were missing from windows\n8 - Hot water at the kitchen tap disappeared after 10 seconds of running.\n\nWe're not commonly critical people, but our experience could have been so much better by paying the same price, at another venue. (the cleaning fee bumps the daily costs up to 95 bucks).",

Visited during the off-season and it was an incredibly peaceful place.\n\nStayed in Rob's apartment as a base for mountain biking around Fernie and had a fantastic time.\n\nWould definitely stay again!",

          "comment": "We really enjoyed our stay and even extended it an extra day here. We stayed in the off season so it was very peaceful and quiet. The place was very clean and although a bit outdated, super comfortable and cozy. We never ended up using the kitchen as we went out to eat but the kitchen was fully stocked with everything we would have needed to make any meal we wanted. We really enjoyed the pool and hottub, and loved that you booked your time slot and it was private and you had it all to yourselves. We just wish the hours for the pool were extended as it was only open 9-5. But it was easy to book in as it wasn't busy. \nThe Rusty Edge wasn't open as it was offseason as well but that was ok as there is plenty of restaurants in Fernie.\nThis place would be amazing in the winter when the hill is open! We definitely would love to come and stay again!",

It was truly a home away from home and we have nothing negative to say about this place.  It is incredibly well stocked - kitchen, bathrooms, even the living room with games and cards and puzzles.  It was incredibly clean.  Beds were huge and warm and extremely comfortable.  Smart TV had netflix, disney plus, amazon prime, etc.  You are only a quick drive away from the ski hill or into the town proper, or you can walk or bike along the river to get into town.  It was amazing.  Do not hesitate to book this place for a large group of family or friends.  Thank you so much Betsy!",

The photos in the listing are very accurate and the place is spacious and very well appointed. Plenty of sleeping space would also make this a great option for families. One minor downside is the location is a bit further away from downtown entertainment and restaurants and walking is not an option. With no ride sharing services and limited taxi service in Fernie transportation is a bit challenging.",

There is a garage , but neither of our SUVs fit, so one of us had to park on the street a short walk away.",

Kitchen is well equipped with pots/pans for cooking, and when we had food delivered the driver found the place easily. There is a flight of stairs up to the main floor, as well as another flight of stairs to the upper bedroom. Communication was quick, and check in was easy. We appreciated the extra parking spaces (we drove separately) as we know these spots aren’t necessarily always included in a busy complex. Instructions for cleaning and check out were clear as well.",

          "comment": "Our experience at Ashley's place was extremely memorable. I came to Fernie after driving across Ontario with a group of 6 (in total 7) for a place to stay for about half of our online remote university semester. I did a lot of research on places all over Canada and came across Ashley's place in Fernie that was perfect for what we required and it was within our price range, albeit the upper end. Ultimately, we decided on Ashley's place because of Fernie and the house checked all the boxes. Ashley was very responsive and helpful in the preparation for our arrival, including temporarily upgrading the internet package. When we first arrived at the townhouse, after a stunning drive into the mountains, all our expectations were surpassed. The place was exactly as shown in the pictures and extremely clean and well set up. It was way more spacious than we expected from a townhouse and the views from every patio/balcony/deck was just amazing. Not to mention the couch in the basement which is genuinely the best couch I've ever experienced. During our stay, Ashley was incredibly responsive and helpful (especially as we worked out some internet issues and minor repairs) which kept the stay running smoothly. One thing I will warn groups about is how thin the walls are and how easily sound travels, so definitely be mindful of your volume after quiet hours. In terms of the location, it was perfect for us. My group loved the close proximity to so many hiking/biking/walking trails, the river and the downtown area was a very short drive away. There is also a gas station conveniently located around the corner that got a lot of our business during our stay. All in all, there is nothing I would change about our experience - I have nothing but positive things to say. If you are debating on where you want to take your next vacation/study term/getaway, I hope you highly consider Fernie. The town has everything you need and so many unique small businesses, too. Everyone always looks happy and active (despite being right in the middle of a pandemic) and with the amazing views 24/7, it's so easy to feel like the town is home quite early on. After all, there's a reason you hear of A LOT of people that came to the town \"temporarily\" yet have ended up staying for years or decades. In my eyes, Fernie is a one of a kind place and if you choose to visit, you can be sure your stay at Ashley's place is the perfect place to make the most out of your short term or long term stay.",

As family with kids, we enjoyed having two living rooms, well equipped kitchen, and lots of space for play and relaxing after long days of skiing. We will remember a big, wooden dining table that allow us to have family dinners by the fireplace. We will consider staying at Ashley’s place again when we visit Fernie.",

Lots of room at the front door for gear, coats, etc.  There are two different living rooms and the bedrooms are all good sizes.  The beds were extremely comfortable! Lots of room for sitting in the dining room as well.  Nice little back deck with bbq/patio set and a picnic table down on the lawn.  I highly recommend this place and hope to be back myself! Only a quick drive to the hill!",

          "comment": "Ok stay here. \nAshley was nice during check in and was quite responsive. Beds were comfy and we had a Roku to use which was nice. \nHowever the internet is not secure and hardly works. I was unable to work from there for most of the time and had to travel in town for work. \nFurther, there are really no amenities so you are unable to cook. Microwave and fridge are tiny, and there was no kettle. \nParking was difficult, we almost always had to park on the road since the lot was always full, especially on weekends.\nNot a lot of closet or drawer space either (about 5 hangers per “closet” and no drawers, just night table) \nThe “balcony” was just a shared patio out front which was covered in snow so we didn’t exactly get to use it either. \nThis room is also connected to another full house where noise travels very easily, you can pretty much hear everything (movies, cooking, footsteps, conversations). There is actually a door that connects the two units on the inside and although it didn’t happen, it’s easy for someone to just walk into our space.\n\nFinally, a red flag here is that Ashley requested additional payment via e transfer (violates airbnb’s policy) for damages that we did not cause. \n\nAll in all it was alright, we had fun as Fernie is beautiful :) however I feel like it the value is not there as we paid around $2k for three weeks and would prefer staying in town for that price next.",

It has a nice hot spa out front and is very close to the mountain. Shuttle busses can take you into town from right out front. My only complaint was it is the master bedroom of the adjoining suite with a separate entrance. Their is absolutely no sound proofing. In the door which is locked  and You can hear every word people are saying next  door. Luckily it was empty all week but on Friday some guys checked in. They weren’t particularly noisy or rowdy, just three guys coming back In the evening talking in conversational levels. I couldn’t sleep for two hours until they’ve retired for the night . I would be sure you check that the suite next door is vacant if you want just the bedroom.",

We really appreciated the mini fridge and cutlery that was provided in the room, it allowed us to make some of our meals rather than eating out which cut down on the overall cost of the weekend. The room was very easy to find and both check in and check out were simple and we had no issues! Chris's explanations were very thorough and easy to understand. We will be returning!",

Water pressure in the shower was poor and erratic for hot and cold. TV was very basic and no coffee or tea provided. So it was a very average experience, nothing bad but not great either.",

It was nice to have 2 chairs to sit in to watch TV as well as the two chairs at the eating table. The bed was comfy.  Loved the access to the hot tub. The SaveOn grocery store was just under 2km away and so a walkable distance-as was the main downtown area of Fernie. We would stay again.",

The balcony view is of the mountains and trees.\nWe have no complaints about this Airbnb and everything worked just fine - in fact we enjoyed ourselves so much we added another month to our stay (total 2 months).  \nThe beds & linens were very comfortable, 2 full washrooms, fully stocked kitchen and supplies, large washing machine & dryer inside the unit, the A/C worked quickly to cool all the rooms, excellent WiFi and 2 large tv’s with full cable, large dining table that also works very well as a work station.  \nThe underground secured parkade is cool in the summer and has a place for bikes.  The building residents are quiet and respectful.  We would be happy to rebook Mark’s unit for our next Fernie visit.  \nHighly recommend!",

Easy access to the ski resort, heated garage under the building makes it easy to leave in the morning. \n\nBeds are quite comfortable and we all slept very well. The living room is nice and a good place to relax by the fireplace at the end of the day. The kitchen is a bit small but contains everything needed to cook on site. \n\nOverall a good place to stay.",

Parents:  This is the greatest travel hack ever, as the kids keep their mess in the top bunk, leaving the rest of the place (mostly) for the adults to enjoy.\n\nThe hosts were very attentive; we had a little incident with the BBQ, but the situation was attended to right away, and we felt 100% assured that we were taken care of.\n\nThe open parking in the parkade and the ski lockers were a nice touch.  Also, if you're looking for some great local recommendations for restaurants, cafes, or other entertainment, Aiden's got all the info for you.  We'll definitely stay again next time we're in Fernie!",

Great communication and very quick to respond to any questions we may have had. 2 bedrooms and a loft, with a dining area and kitchen; our stay at Sarah's place was very comfortable with teenage kids. Location is great, not too close to town (not that town is busy haha) and very close to mountain biking or the ski hill. Would definitely stay here again. Thanks!",

It is located within a few minute drive to town and close to Fernie Alpine Resort.\n\nSarah was very responsive all the way through and made our check-in, stay and check-out seamless. The condo is well equipped with everything you need in the kitchen, bathrooms and bedrooms. The amenities in the building were great as well with an outdoor hot tub and an indoor pool + steam room. There is a small gym area but we did not have a chance to make use of it. Extra towels for the hot tub were also appreciated.  There was parking available for our rental car which made it easy to get to and from Fernie alpine resort.\n\nOverall we had a fantastic stay and would gladly stay here again on our next visit to Fernie!",

The suite itself had not been properly cleaned - I found a dirty pair of underwear in the bed and the host admitted to not having changed the sheets before I had stayed. \n\nAdditionally, I stayed here for a clinical placement during the COVID19 pandemic so after my first week I was recalled by UBC medicine back to Vancouver. I therefore didn't use 3 weeks of my stay and the host ignored the messages asking for a partial refund - as a student in lots of debt I really could use the money and found it really awful that they wouldn't do this, especially since the suite was already poorly cleaned when I had stayed. Just a surprisingly lack of kindness at a time of distress.\n\nAs for the suite itself - it's about as nice as a 2 star motel room with a kitchen. Not worth the price.",

The place itself had everything I needed. Was nice to have a full kitchen. It has a very hotel like vibe. With Covid the gym and pool were closed but that is another great perk of this location. \nSome minor areas for improvement:\n- cleaning is due for a deep clean. Not a big deal but with Covid, it makes you feel a little weary about the stuff you maybe can't see\n- there is a slight smell of cigerette smoke in the room.\n Nicola mentioned this was a problem with the building ventilation they are looking into. \n- the dishwasher is excessivly noisy. I turned it off and hand washed dishes instead. Plan to use when you are going out for the day. \n\nOverall, for the price I paid it was a good value. I would stay again.",

It worked great for our family; comfy beds, downstairs bedrooms for the kids, a lovely great room with an excellent large sectional. There are only 2 lawn chairs, so we were glad we had brought some. Nice quick bike ride into town and a lovely evening walk over to the Elk River behind the townhouse. Fernie was a lot of fun in the summer...lots of great hikes, beaches and things to do. Thanks for a great get away!",

The location was great for us - we biked to all the trails and had easy access to the great hiking trails.  The hot tub was a must with all the activity we did.  As well we had 3 couples and the spaciousness of the condo was perfect.  The garage was also a must as a place to store our bikes/golf clubs and inside had plenty of storage for our gear. I highly recommend this place.",

There were plenty of nice quality linens, toiletries, and kitchen supplies. The open concept kitchen was great for cooking meals. The beds were very comfortable, and we didn’t hear any noise from the neighbouring condo (despite multiple vehicles being parked out front) We really enjoyed the hot tub, and appreciated being able to logon to our Netflix account on the smart TV in the living room.

I spent 2.5 hours cleaning the kitchen and hot tub before being able to settle in. Be prepared to buy your own hand soap for the kitchen, Keurig cups/pods for the Keurig and bring Lysol to wipe down high touch surfaces. Cleaning staff do not wear masks and there are no 24-hour delays between guests. Scented candles were a nice touch and the pillows and beds were very comfortable. BBQ is great. Location is breath taking. A fully stocked kitchen with condiments and essentials throughout. Stairs are quite steep. Be prepared to bring a baby gate if you have younger ones. Main floor bathroom shower is a bit small with no real shelving to put hygiene items on. Heated flooring would be extra nice in the winter for your ski chalet adventures. Cheryl is very prompt with responses. She had the cleaning staff reenter, a hot tub service person service the hot tub and a freezer repair man enter to resolve a freezer issue we had during our 5-night stay. All issues were promptly resolved. We appreciated this. Stay was nice. We wrote a lovely review in their guestbook.",

It feels like a nice hotel room, bed in front of the TV (no spare sitting area or separate bedroom).  Super clean, great bed and pillows - something hard to find with Airbnb!  This was a bit of a splurge for us, but worth it!  Chris was one of the best hosts we've ever had - organized and quick to communicate.",

Check in was easy, and Chris was quick in responding to any questions we had.  We also liked that there was an underground parking especially in the winter months. we would stay here again.",

Accessing the lockbox was simple with the very clear instructions that are provided by Christopher everything was a breeze. The building is clean and when we walked into the room it was spotless! There was a perfect little kitchenette, sleeping area, two seat table and a beautiful deck on the opposite side away from the noise of the highway. A loft just as described, no separate rooms other than the bathroom. The kitchen had everything we needed to make simple meals, full size fridge and dishwasher if needed. The bed was very comfortable with clean bedding. Bathroom has a shower/ tub and was very clean with extra towels. Christopher provided very clear instructions on house rules and check in/ check out procedures. The underground parking was an excellent bonus. The pool was very cold! so we just stuck to the hot tub, both older but nice feature to have. Would recommend Christopher's Place to anyone looking to stay in Fernie BC for any kind of get away. Hiking, biking, skiing or just relaxing. We hope to stay there again in the future!",

The building was nice & it was very quiet during our stay. Mark did a great job stocking the place with everything we needed. The washer & dryer were definitely an extra perk! The views of the mountains from the deck were amazing :) \nThanks for a great stay Mark!",

          "comment": "Great condo, nice to be able to cook sometimes as well, though lots of great restaurants nearby (Blue Toque - use their online wait list, Big Bang Bagels, Happy Cow, food trucks, etc). Nice easy hike is across the highway on MacDonald at the end of Hesketh St that goes along the river and into town. Also great hikes up to Island Lodge (old growth forest trail and lake trails) with a great outdoor patio for lunch at the top in the lodge. Be aware that all condo amenities were closed (pool, fitness, outdoor hot tub, sauna and steam room). Fireplace in the living room does work though. There are 3 luggage trolleys in the lobby by the lockboxes to use when you arrive and depart. Patio has a great mountain view (noisy - bring headphones with you) - there are Highway sounds for any light sleepers - bring a noise machine with you. Construction on bridges at Fernie and Crowsnest Pass go until Fall 2020 which make weekend traffic very slow on Highway 3 (allow an extra hour from Crowsnest to the Condo) - you’ll see it on google maps with wait times listed. Fernie Brewery has a great patio just outside town - bring takeout food with you as they don’t have a kitchen but they allow outside foods. Fernie Distillers has great in-house cocktails.",

Great kitchen with the basics covered. The building was clean and felt very safe amid the coronavirus pandemic. Check in and out was extremely simply and Mark responded to my questions swiftly and clearly. We did not use the pool or hot tub (because of covid-19) so I can’t speak to those amenities. We will definitely return to Marks place! Thank you, Mark!",

The location is great, close to downtown and the park and a nice quiet building. We had no issues, check in was smooth and the communication was great, the Covid mask reminder was really appreciated. We will definitely come back as we really enjoyed our time in Fernie, thanks to some of Sarah and Craig’s recommendations. Great hosts!",

It was great having underground parking for our truck and having the option of the elevator was appreciated when bringing stuff up.  A quick walk to downtown, if you don't feel like driving, was just what we like. I highly recommend Steve's condo, and will definitely book this again when we are in Fernie.",

Probably a better spot for short-term accommodations. The Wi-Fi was quite slow, and we didn't have access to the pool, gym or hot tub while we were there due to COVID. The host did not tell us about this before we booked so were surprised when we arrived. When we asked for a partial refund due to the listed facilities being closed, the host got confrontational and we had to resolve with AirBnB. Overall, the condo was great however I cannot say the same about the host. If you're there short-term and don't anticipate interacting with Stephen much, this should do just fine.",

The beds are all a good size, very comfortable and we slept great  The building was quiet and we were not bothered by outside noise. It was very nice to have underground parking. Just a couple minutes drive to the ski hill. Darryl is a great host and quickly responded to our questions.",

I appreciated his quick communication including remedying a small appliance issue in a very timely manner - it was appreciated.\nOur group did have a few frustrations with respect to the house rules listed and the 'building rules' which should have also been listed in the house rules. I encourage all future guests to read the separate link for the Silver Rock as we were surprised to find a $1,000 fine would be given to anyone bringing sporting goods into the building. This meant us having to find bike locks last minute to leave expensive mountain bikes in the parkade overnight. \nThere was also some discrepancy with the mask mandate. The day before checking-in we were told of a strictly enforced mask mandate that would result in a $200 PER OFFENSE fine to anyone seen in the building without a mask. We complied with this mandate however found that a very limited number of other guests and visitors to the building also wore masks.",

The accommodation is well equipped for 6 people, we only stayed with 4, so had lots of space to move around. The back deck is sheltered and has a tree for some much needed shade and is lovely to sit and relax after a day out and about. We did not use the BBQ, but it is nice to have one anyway. One little thing: In the basement, the room with the 2 single beds,  the air vents is directly over the head part of one of the beds, just switch the pillows to the other side to prevent a stiff neck the morning, no big deal. Hopefully we can come back one day, it was a great place to stay! Thank you David for your hospitality! \nEllen, Ghost Lake Alberta",

There are access points to the river, just a short jaunt from the condo. Across the highway are winding trails through enchanted forests that fairy dreams are made of. A short drive to the ski hill brings you plenty to do in all seasons...ski hill by winter and zipline park by summer!<br><br>Our condo is a half flight of stairs up from the parking lot. We have 2 (unassigned) parking spaces and ski/snowboard lockers to store your gear. Town is just a short few minutes drive, with, as is the ski hill and all that it has to offer.<br><br>The king bedroom is locked off from the main unit and may have guests in it.  It has its own exterior entrance.  You may be able to book the entire unit it if it is available.  View my profile to see the 3 bedroom listing.",

The location was fantastic; easy to access trails and close to the downtown area for groceries and restaurants. Bikes are not allowed in the building, so we left ours in the car in the parking garage. It seemed pretty safe. It’s a town full of expensive bikes. The space is a good size and well stocked. The king sized bed is very soft. The building is pretty warm, so we were glad we had our fan along. It was reasonably quiet for a condo and the suite doesn’t face the highway, which was nice. And in-suite laundry was an awesome benefit. Communication was super quick for any questions we had. Overall we had a great stay and would happily return.",

          "comment": "First to good:  great bed! Also bonus of underground secure parking where you can leave your bikes. \n\nNow to the bad: this place is very small. If there are more than 2 of you you will not be able to move around at all. BRING OWN FAN! Even tho it is air conditioned the air conditioner/heater is located in the master bedroom (who designed these places?) and sounds like a jet airplane taking off! And if you think you want to go out on the miniature filthy deck forget about it-the a/c dumps it’s exhaust through a giant register right on to the very small deck (again who designed these places?) Also the 2 vents for heating/a/c are right on you when sleeping or sitting in living area (who designed this?) Kitchen had many things missing and appeared to be garage sale mismatched items. Many old and sticky, etc. Bathroom very small. Summary: probably not a do over. And btw I doubt any of the units in this building would be acceptable as it is a very noisy location.",

We have set up the kitchen for cooking w/Henckel knives, dishwasher etc. Leather couch, Queen bed, thermostat controlled gas fireplace heat, living room,  full bath, high speed internet, shared coin-op laundry, walk in closet. During summer it is a nice cool temperature. Walking distance to anywhere in town!<br><br>Please read through the entire listing, nothing worse then having a guest show up and the suite is not what they expect:)<br><br>A nice quiet apartment in an older house that has been tastefully remodeled, with an Alpine rustic feel, leather couch, thermostat controlled gas fireplace, comfy bed.  Perfect for a couple. We like to cook and assume that you do too, so the kitchen, we think, is well equipped, Henckel Knives, decent cookware, dishwasher, etc.  Convenient location only two blocks to the Annex park, and Dike walking trails, 20 minute walk to downtown.  The unit is set up for a couple only, infants that are not walking, they pretty much live in Mom's arms, are welcome at no extra charge. The gas fireplace is the source of heat and is controlled by a thermostat. The extra charge for an extra guest is $100/night.  We do not allow people to sleep on the couch as it does not fit in the washing machine, :).  Friday or Saturday stays are a minimum of two nights. <br><br>For you Mtn Bikers with expensive bikes we have a lockup, although when I built the closet handlebars were shorter so you may have to remove the front wheel.  We also have a bike stand for mechanical work and washing stand with a hose provided.<br><br>The suite has its own entrance and access to the shared coin operated laundry room. The suite is set up just for our AirBnb guests.  If you are travelling with a companion please list their name when you inquire/book or I will forget.   Please tell us a little about yourself and why you are coming to Fernie, we may be able to offer some local advice to enhance your stay.  Your reservation must be for the correct number of people you show up with, insurance rules. If  you are new to AirBnb, welcome to the sharing community, we have met some great people this way. Each AirBnb is a little different so please  read through the entire listing, nothing worse then having a guest show up and the suite is not what they expect.   We do require that you are \"Verified\" by AirBnb with government ID and profile photo to book our suite.  We will ask to see your ID at check in.<br><br>We have a WiFi Ring Camera outside with 2 way communication if we need to talk to you to assist  you in getting in.  If you have any troubles please give us a call or text any time of day.<br><br>Please show up and have a happy Holiday :)<br><br>There is a shared coin operated laundry room and a lockup for bikes, skis, boards, etc.  The door uses a 4 digit code for access so no key is needed, the code is changed for each guest for security and is easy to remember.  Free parking outside the suite. Please read house rules prior to booking. Friday or Saturday stays are a minimum of two nights. We installed a WiFi Ring Camera outside with 2 way communication if we need to talk to you to assist  you in getting in.  Please make sure you properly declare and provide the name of your travelling companion.  If you show up with more people then you reserved for your extra guest (infants in moms arms exempted) will be denied entry and your reservation will be cancelled without refund.  We are not setup to handle more then the stated number of guest.  This makes everybody happy and isn't that the point of a Holiday?<br>With Covid 19 we have enhanced cleaning procedures that take longer to complete, so we rarely can provide early check in or late check out.  Please request these as far in advance as possible to allow us to rearrange schedules if we can.<br><br>We try to greet guests, socially distanced, when you arrive or the next day if we can otherwise we may give you a call to go through a few things.  We can give you local recommendations and tips to make your stay in Fernie memorable.<br><br>A short walk to the groomed dyke for X-C skiing or walking.  Our favorite restaurant, Yama Goya Sushi - the best sushi in Calgary is in Fernie, is just a few blocks away.  The Kodiak Lounge (best price on pints) at the Raging Elk Hostel is also a few blocks away.  20 minute walk to the far side of downtown and other restaurants and bars.<br><br>Two blocks to the shuttle bus to the ski hill.  20 minute walk to downtown, 2 blocks to the river dike trail system.<br><br>Once you arrive if we are available we can give you a rundown of good restaurants and other amenities you may be interested in.  Two grocery stores in town (Save On Foods on 2nd ave downtown and Anne's Independent  by Tim Horton's on 9th and Hwy 3).     <br>We live in the house so you will hear activity, but we had insulation blown into the ceiling so you will not hear conversations or our TV, but we do live  upstairs so....  Quiet hours start at 9:30 pm, I get up for work at 5 am (ugh) so we are not loud at night and we expect the same from our guests.  The suite only has one bed and we do not allow guests to sleep on the couch as it does not fit in the washing machine.<br>During the winter Friday or Saturday stays are a minimum of two nights.",

Since this is a basement suite, you will hear the airbnb guests upstairs. It shouldn't be a problem unless you go to sleep very early or sleep late (outside of the quiet hours). The kitchen appliances are new and work so well - the best electric stove I've ever used. The location is great and easy for anything you would need in and around Fernie. We stayed a month and fell in love with Fernie.",

It is also nice and cool in the summer, great after a hot day of biking/hiking. Full bath, walk-in closet, high speed internet, shared coin operated laundry. We like to cook so we have the kitchen set up for easy meal prep. The suite is perfect for a couple, please don't ask to bring extra people. 15 - 20 min walk to downtown.<br><br>Please read through the entire listing, nothing worse then having a guest show up and the suite is not what they expect.<br><br> While the house is no architectural wonder, its a older house with significant reno's. The suite is dedicated and private, set up just for guests.  The apartment gets morning sun, if it is out.  Walk-in closet, large bath, full kitchen (no dishwasher), shared coin op laundry.  Cozy place to be after a hard day of skiing, hiking, biking or relaxing. High Speed internet, TV, separate entrance.<br><br> Super comfy King bed. We don't allow sleeping on the other couch as it doesn't fit in the washer. The suite is under our bedrooms and we have found that if there is four people (two couples) the noise can be a bit much for our quiet hours so we limit it to two people (infants are welcome). If you show up with more then 2 people we will either not allow extra people or charge $100/person/night extra. <br><br>Please list all guests first names when you book.  Infants who are not walking are welcome, they pretty much live in Mom's arms, no extra fee.<br><br>Quiet hours start at 9:30 pm, If you don't think you will be able to control yourself noise wise please don't rent from us.  The suite is part of our house so you will hear that their are people above, but we had blown in insulation in the floor/ceiling to help with soundproofing, it really limits the sound transmission, but it is not absolute.  We take your peaceable enjoyment seriously.<br><br>Stays over 7 days may be charged a second cleaning fee, if you are coming for a shift at the coal mine you will be charged $50 for every 7 days.  The coal dust is brutal and we need to keep the suite clean for the next guest.<br><br>Absolutely NO SMOKING on the property.  If you smoke on our property your stay will be cancelled immediately without refund and you will forfeit your full damage deposit to cover excessive cleaning costs and to ensure peaceable enjoyment of future guests.<br><br>Please list names of all guests so I won't forget what to call them.  If  you are new to AirBnb, welcome to the sharing community, however you must be fully \"Verified\" with government ID and a proper profile photo to book our suite.  All guests will be required to show ID and allow us to keep a copy at check in.  The copy will be destroyed after checkout.<br>We have a WiFi Camera outside with 2 way communication if we need to talk to you to assist  you in getting in.<br><br>Two day Minimum for stay's including Friday or Saturday.<br><br>Keyless entry, so no key required. We have a WiFi Camera outside with 2 way communication if we need to talk to you to assist  you in getting in.<br><br>We live in the house so we are available to give some local tips on restaurants, groceries, etc.<br><br>Two blocks to  groomed trails for cross country or walking and three blocks to Highway 3, walking distance to restaurants and pubs.  A little further to downtown but no cab needed after visiting local watering holes.  Our favorite restaurant, Yama Goya Sushi - the best sushi in Calgary is in Fernie, is just a few blocks away.  The Kodiak Lounge (best price on pints, great atmosphere) at the Raging Elk Hostel is also a few blocks away.  Other nearby restaurants, The Curry Bowl, Fernie Pizza & Pasta, The Smokehouse at Red Tree Lodge.<br><br>The shuttle bus stop to the ski hill is only two blocks away.  20 min walk to downtown.  2 blocks to the Elk River walking and X-Country trails.<br><br>Once you arrive we can give you a rundown of good restaurants and other amenities you may be interest in.  Two grocery stores in town (Save On Foods on 2nd ave and Anne's Independent by Tim Horton's on 9th and Hwy 3).  There is no Uber here and only one taxi company.",

It was pouring rain when we got there so the fireplace was toasty and awesome, but later in the week it was warm and sunny so a cool basement suite was nice!  It is a bright basement but has room darkening shades so you can sleep well.  We had a relaxed trip and were comfortable there!",

          "comment": "Mentioned in the listing that there was a futon with sheets to request, and additional people would be 100 dollars a night or turned away.\n\nWe were two guests and last minute another friend joined, I messaged them right away (9 AM the morning of check in, a little last minute but) with the new request. I stated we had another, I asked if my two friebds could sleep in the apartment so I would be in the van. My plan was to follow up with requesting futon sheets. The hosts then informed me that there was no longer a futon, and they lived in a family area so no one could sleep in the van. They then changed the listing about the futon and cancelled our stay without any discussion\n\nI ended up finding other lodging, however they left me a review. I am not too bothered by the situation but I am writing this to share my side of the story.",

This unit met and exceeded my needs.\n\nOnly a couple streets away from a grocery store and fast food. Definitely walkable. \n\nThe hosts were very accommodating and had good communication. Check in was easy using a passcode. \n\nWould definitely stay here again!",

      "descriptions_description": "Our large, bright, upstairs part of the house has a log king bed in the master. Renting out for couples. Open concept great room, 40\" stainless stove, gas fireplace. Well setup kitchen for great meals. Large deck w/BBQ to enjoy the sunshine if it is out and views to the three sisters. It is an older house that has been tastefully remodeled over the years.  It will be a great, comfortable place to create a great meal after a of day of skiing. Downtown is 20 min walk, walking trails are 2 blocks<br><br>This house is a divided house and has two other suites downstairs with separate entrances. Since it is a 3 bedroom house it has 2 full baths and a large living room and a nice kitchen and dining area.  Due to Covid a 3 bedroom place is not renting well, so we are setting it up (price wise) for a couple or two people with the expectation that only the master bedroom will be used.  The other two suites are downstairs and have separate entrances, so you will not be sharing any living space with other guests. <br><br>The other two bedrooms will be locked off.  Due to this being a multi unit house, we bill it as a quiet house.  So at about 10 pm or so tone it down for the consideration of other guests. \"Ski hard so you go to sleep.\"<br><br>Parking can be a little tight, so we have two stacked spaces out front.  If you need more parking I maintain another 2 spots out back off the alley.  Please be respectful of the other guests when it comes to parking.  If there are no guests in the other suites will let you know so you can park two cars out front.<br><br>We have blown in insulation in the floor so you shouldn't hear the people downstairs but your footsteps will be heard downstairs,  So this is a no party house and we have quiet hours  from 9:30 pm until 8 am.  Again please be respectful of the other guests.<br>Downstairs is a shared coin operated laundry, this is the only space that is shared.<br><br>If you show up with more then the two people booked its an extra $100/person/night. In other words please don't try to pull one over.   If you want all 3 bedrooms we have a rate for that. it is cheaper then showing up with extra's.<br><br>The upstairs has 3 bedrooms, but only the master will be available with a large bright living room and two baths which will be yours alone, no sharing of the space.  The laundry room is downstairs and is shared with the other suites.   Parking is tight especially in the winter with the big snow banks.  So please do not park on the street as it can affect our neighbors thus disrupting the tranquility of the neighborhood.  Additional parking is in the back.<br><br>We will usually stop in once you have checked in to give you a little update on the house and little quirks it has.  If this is your first time to Fernie we can give you a little run down on what Fernie has to offer.<br><br>The Annex area of Fernie is on the west side of town situated between the Highway and the river.  Just two blocks away is the river, dike and Annex park.  The Dike trail is groomed in the winter and will eventually lead you close to town or to one of the grocery stores.  We are only 3 blocks from the highway and there are a number of restaurants with in walking distance. It is a 20 minute walk to downtown and a 8 minute drive to the ski hill.<br><br>The shuttle bus stop to the ski hill is 3 blocks away.  One of Fernie's grocery store is a short 7 blocks away.<br><br>We use locks with codes, so no keys to lose.  Three days before your arrival we will send you check in instructions and a  simple to remember personalized code.  <br>We have parking in front for two cars, one in the carport and another stacked behind it.  There is additional parking in the back.  We will let you know if any other additional parking spots in front are available.  We do not allow parking on the street as it affects our neighbors, thus disrupting the tranquility of the neighborhood. There is no Hot tub but Airbnb keeps telling people there is.",

Negatives:  no drawers in the bedrooms for clothing so we just relied on closet hangers and shelf plus our suitcases to organize clothing.  Also the only seating for meals is at the kitchen counter or the living room sectional.  Parking garage was convenient especially with many surface lots caked with ice during the time of our stay.  Hot tub, pool and gym are a plus.  Krista was always quick to respond to questions.   We would definitely consider staying here again when in Fernie - thank you Krista!",

Spacious and really clean - my young son was playing on the floor and it was totally clean for him. Dining space is limited to the counter top - it would be great to have even a small dining table because the kitchen is so well-equipped and we wanted to eat in. Also wished for a dresser or shelves in the bedrooms for clothes that couldn't be hung in the closets. Other than that, an amazing stay and can highly recommend it.",

The location is great and the property itself is gorgeous - impressive view, large yard, bocce balls etc. We suggest proactively letting Rick know if the loft is untidy or not appearing to have been cleaned (floors, counters, bathroom) etc. and upon checkout it is in your best interest to do a thorough clean to avoid any unexpected cleaning charges atop of the cleaning fee. This property is manged by an agency, however we had the opportunity to meet Rick personally and he is a friendly guy. \n\nWe'd typically give a 5 star rating but our experience at checkout was a bit of a drag.\n\nWe still recommend this place and would stay their again.... without our small children.",

For us, it was in just the right spot - close enough to wander into town (by car), and far enough away from the business of the town site. Absolutely majestic views of the mountains, that reside in your back garden. Literally every window you look out of, there is something of beauty to see. It's so quiet, I forgot about the insanity of the world around us (yes, I wrote this during covid-19). The bungalow was spotless... Like, remarkably clean - a really welcome sight. Traci answered my questions patiently and promptly (yes, I'm one of those best types with lots of questions), and was friendly throughout. Highly recommend.",

The house is well appointed and very clean. Check in was easy and Traci was prompt in replying to our messages. The town of Fernie was unexpected bonus for us. We played golf at the Fernie club, which he highly recommend! Views are stunning. We really enjoyed dinner at Tamarack (at the Island Lake Lodge) and walking to Fairy Creek Falls. We look forward to coming back one day! Thank you Traci 😊",

We arrived in the dark during a torrential rain storm so we didn't have an appreciation of where we were.  It was such a relief to find ourselves in a clean, spaceous and warm place to call our home over the Thanksgivng week end. In the morning when I opened the curtains what a surprise. The sun was shining on the mountain tops all around us and a row of cattle were standing at the fence, a few feet from the house, curiously looking in on us. When I stepped outside rabbits darted across the yard. We had a wonderful 3 days exploring, hiking, eating out in a very COVID-19 responsible restaurant and cooking our Thanksgiving dinner. Thank you, Traci, for a wonderful experience.",

The reason we keep coming back is due to how well she treats her guests, flexible, kind and quick with replies. \n\nI can not recommend renting from her more. Well worth the stay, and i hope to come back again soon.",

It happened to be a couple of the hottest days in Fernie and the unit got up to and stayed at around 28 deg C. Not a single bit of sleep happened on the first night. A very loud portable AC unit was dropped off on the second night which helped. \nThe unit itself is very nice. I just wouldn't stay here in the summer.",

I was in  Fernie fat biking and had the work a bit too; the heated garage felt secure to store my bike and the internet was plenty fast to remote into work.  I loved the fire place and large TV.  This is the ultimate place to stay for an active solo traveler and plenty  big for a couple.  I'll be back and you should consider it too.",

I would not recommend staying here if you have children, ten minutes after we arrived the neighbour downstairs knocked on the door and complained we were “walking too loud” and asked us to keep it down. We have a very quiet 4 year old. There were also wires coming out of a hole in the wall in the lounge room. The fireplace also didn’t work. Very overpriced for an average condo. Also was not keen on paying an $80 cleaning fee and being asked to take our own garbage out.",

Allison’s property was right on the edge of town which was amazing for going out for food and hikes!\n\nThe property was just as described - nice balcony with a decent view out the back, two big rooms and bathrooms with a pull out couch as well! We had all the cooking utensils/appliances we needed and the amenities in the building were great - we spent a lot of time in the pool and outdoor hot tub!\n\nAllison was quick to reply with all of the information we needed and was very nice :) \n\nWe had a really great time for a really great price! We would definitely come back.",

Allison's housekeeping is excellent- such lovely fluffy white towels!  The kitchen is well equipped for cooking and eating in.   A very cozy place- thank you, Allison!  Do double check with Allison to make sure the pool is actually open when you will be there- we were very disappointed to find it closed due to the pandemic.",

Though the unit is advertised as having air conditioning, it was broken the first night and is located in another room where we couldn’t access it so not only could we not control the temperature but the other guests could change our settings. It resulted in a very poor first night. The host was quick to respond to messages and accessing the unit was easy. It’s a few kilometers from any shops, restaurants or the downtown but closer to the ski hill. The host says the walls are thin as a warning in the ad and they are. You can clearly hear the other guests and smell their cooking. ",

The wifi was sent to us through email and was easily accessible. The amenities were great...netflix, all of your essentials including towels and shampoo. The room was very clean and perfect as a private small space! We will surely be back. Thank you Ryland!! ",

The location is very handy to the mountains and the lovely town of Fernie, less than a five minute drive to either.  As a host, Ryland couldn't have been better.  He was accommodating, quick and clear in his communication and super helpful.  For example, we needed help in finding a place to store our travel trailer for a week.  Ryland was quick to give suggestions and offered further help if needed.  Well above and beyond.  I would definitely stay in this, or one of Ryland's other properties, again.  ",

When I told him my concerns that were valid safety issues he was very defensive and rude. The bed was extremely uncomfortable as well as the very noisy outside resulted in my only getting 2 hours of sleep, the heating took at least 2 hours to turn on and when it did, it was not very effective. There was some sort of splatter on the bathroom wall, the baseboards were very very dirty exct. I feel completely ripped off and am very, very unimpressed, he could have handled the situation better but was unbelievably rude. There are much better/affordable places in town with very lovely hosts. ",

The last two nights i didn't get much sleep because the absolute worst tenants renting the space next to this one (joined by a locked off door)were screaming and jumping on the ceiling  and smashing things and fighting. However I texted Ryland and he immediately texted the other renters and told them to be quiet. (Even tho they didn't listen to him), I really appreciated Ryland's quick response to my inquiries and his attempt to solve the problem. As it turns out this area has an 11 pm quiet time bylaw, and the people in the room next door jumped up and down on the ceiling and screamed at the top of their lungs till 10:59. Im glad the insanity eventually stopped but i was at wits end by 11pm trying to sleep and repeatedly had to curb the urge to call police...it was that bad! My suggestion would be to not allow those renters at your property again and i sincerely Hope they didn't wreck the place as Ryland you seem like a genuinely nice person who tries very hard to facilitate a good experience for those who stay. This is not intended to be a bad review whatsoever as Rylands customer service was impeccable, just wanting to share my experience honestly as without honesty this system of peer to peer review doesn't help anyone. I would stay here again and just hope that his was a one off negative experience as the value is overall quite good for the price. ",

It’s accessible from the living room and bedroom.  The kitchen is perfectly serviceable with microwave and dishwasher.  \nThere is little to no road noise but as with most of these mountin pass towns the train comes through a few times a night.",

It is right on the Elk River, so my husband could walk down to the river to fish.  The day  before were were to check in, we received an email telling us to be sure not to park in the construction zone at the condo. It turned out that roof replacement was still going on ( a review in July had mentioned construction noise), and a couple of the days that we were there, the workers were on the roof over our heads and and it was quite noisy. That was the only downside of our visit, and it would have been helpful to have been prepared for the construction noise when we were given the alert about parking. I understand that these projects need to happen, but it still would have been nice to know that we might have been inconvenienced by the noise. ",

          "comment": "The description of the place is pretty accurate. Why I could only give 3 stars was due to active construction on the roof for our entire stay. We were only told that construction was being done the day prior to our arrival. It made no mention that the place we were staying was going to be involved just said not to park in certain locations and that the construction was 0700-1900 hrs. The construction was right over our heads. Sounded like the roof was going to come down. We had men up on our balcony and I was actually not keen to go onto the deck because there were ropes from the roof coming down onto it. We were in an active construction zone that did affect our stay and what we did. I sent Ryland a note and all I got back was an apology for the inconvenience. We have stayed at other places where we were warned about the construction with ample time and given options to either stay some place else or given a 15% discount. Considering this place was booked 4 months ago and to do any type of construction in a condo/townhome with board approval takes months to plan, I do feel we should have been given more warning and other options. How it was handled was unprofessional and disappointing. ",

The kitchen had e everything you needed for making meals. The bbq was an added bonus but we had to buy a BBQ lighter as we couldn't find one. We were able to bike to down town Fernie from this location with the kids. Some of the biking needed to be done along the busy highway but was manageable.

I sent at least four or five questions both before and during my stay, and Ryland responded within minutes and was very helpful with all my questions. \nThe condo was perfect for my family of five. We used the BBQ for dinner and cooked on the stove for breakfast, and found everything we could need for preparing our meals. We loved the back deck where we could enjoy time outside (even in April) and take in the view of the mountains. \nThe loft area was perfect for my three children. It gave them their own space to hang out and relax a bit before bed. \nIf you are expecting luxury this condo might not be the one for you, as it is a bit tired and run down. That said, if you just need a quiet place with lots of space, fabulous views, and all the basic amenities, this place is perfect. \nThe one and only complaint we had is that the wifi was terrible and we kept getting kicked off. To be fair, we did not address this with the host, so maybe there was something that could have been done about it if we asked. \nWe would definitely stay here again.",

Everyone was happy with the comfort of the beds. The fireplace is a nice cosy touch. If we were ever to come back to Fernie, we would re-book with Ryland. Thank you for having us!",

The kitchen is fairly well stocked with all the pots, pans and utensils you would need. I loved the furniture in the living room and den. The master bedroom is awesome. That said, the other two bedrooms are small but in light of the amount of living space downstairs, this is still a great house with a great location. I would stay in town versus on the mountain at Fernie, in this house, everytime.",

We stayed here with our little boy and found it be a very kid friendly home. The fireplace made for great evening hangout and board game time during our winter stay. We were able to walk to the main downtown strip easily and all the skiing in the area was a very quick drive from the house. We loved our time here and it made for a really great vacation to Fernie. We'd love to stay here again whenever we return.",

The master bedroom is big and can easily fit a family of four and the other two rooms are a little on the smaller side, but still really good and cute. Couple of pull out beds in the den and living room, that with the closing doors to the den makes for an easy 4th bedroom. Few key items were missing from the kitchen, but messaged Todd and they were delivered right away. Overall great place to stay with a group and so nice to be able to walk to town and only a five minute drive to the hill. Thanks Todd!",

We particularly liked the relaxed feel of this house - plenty of room to relax, read a book, listen to music, or play a family card game.\n\nUnlike some places we’ve stayed, this rental house was updated, the appliances were modern and fully working. Neighbours were quiet. We enjoyed the back yard, deck and bbq.  Perfect vacation house for us.",

Large and spacious, but still warm and cozy. \n\nWe loved hanging out by outdoor firepit and bbq, and we all had a great sleep in the big and comfortable beds.\n\nYou also couldn't ask for a better location being right in downtown, walking distance from everything that you need and only a very short drive to the ski hill. \n\nAnd with great value for money, we can't say a bad word about this place!\nDefinitely Definitely Definitely planning on staying again for our next trip to Fernie!",

The location is ideal (close to  downtown and Save On Foods), the backyard is set up great for outside dinners and hangouts and lots of space inside. Would highly recommend staying at Todd's and we look forward to coming back!",

Comfortable set-up with a lot of privacy + a quiet place to retire to at the end of the day. Gord has done a great job of soundproofing the barn, even being above the main floor we felt like the whole place was ours.\n\nGord was a great host, quick to reply to any questions and easy to have a chat with about anything Fernie. \n\nThe barn was extremely tidy and had all the essentials for a great week of riding at the mountain. Just a quick drive to town, easy access to shops, restaurants and about a ten minute drive from the resort. Thank you for hosting us Gord!",

There are plenty of places to hang clothes, a washer/dryer, and the kitchen is really well stocked. The view from the place is pretty as well. The only note to add is that if you care a lot about privacy, you can easily hear the host downstairs when he is around, so I'd assume he can hear you as well.",

          "comment": "Overall this was a good AirBnB find in Fernie. It's a tiny town, so you're about 5 minutes drive away from all the action of downtown, and maybe 10-15 minutes away from the ski resort. The location isn't as secluded as we thought- rather nestled in among other tiny homes and single family homes. But it's right at the top of hill so you catch great views of the mountains. I don't know if more than 2 people would be comfortable staying here, as it's more of a tiny home than a big barn. However, it was sparkling clean and there were plenty of amenities to make yourself at home. The biggest reason I couldn't give this place more stars was the mattress- very thin and uncomfortable. People with back issues or who are just plain picky should be mindful. Our host Gord was an excellent communicator and checked in several times via AirBnB messenger to make sure we were doing okay!",

Amazing views from the living-room. \nWe loved the deck and the BBQ. \nYou are close to the nature just as much as to the town. \nVery easy check-in. \n\nThe Fernie ski resort is very close by. I highly recommend to take the chairlift and enjoy the views from the observation deck. Also - Silver Spring Lakes hike by Elko is amazing! \n\nThe town has a lot of options for restaurants, coffee shops, grocery shopping. \n\nThis is an ideal spot for someone who likes to enjoy the mountains/countryside but also likes the convenience of the town.\n\nOne suggestion that has nothing to do with the cabin - Bring the earplugs as the trains are whistling through Fernie in the middle of the night. \n\nHighly recommended listing, I would stay again.",

The tub is a deep soaker style tub which was a lovely surprise and the kitchen was more than stocked with spices etc for cooking.  Our stay exceeded expectations and we would absolutely rebook it in the future. For the price, you can't find better accommodation in Fernie!",

Such a nice place with a beautiful bedroom and comfy bed. So close to town, literally a 10 minute walk. Dont think twice about Gords place!",

Very clean, comfy bed and a full kitchen with everything you need to make a meal. Gas BBQ and a deck with a  beautiful treed back yard were a nice bonus on our sunny stay. Great star watching at night. \n Mountain views from the large living room window are amazing.\nCheck in and out were easy. Great communication. Gord was a perfect host. We look forward to staying there again the next time we are in the area. Thanks for a great stay.",

Conveniently located 10mins away from Fernie Alpine Resort, it made our travels to and from the hill really quick and easy. The access to the pool and hot tub facilities also helped with those sore ski muscles! The place is very clean, and the two bathrooms definitely make it easy to share the space with multiple people. Matthew and Nancy were quick to respond to our messages and provided very clear instructions and directions to their place. Thank you for having us!",

Matthew was always attentive and quick with the communications. However despite the attention to these details, the fireplace was not working. It was  annoying to have to fiddle around with the fireplace to light the pilot light. It didn't light straight away and took a number of attempts to get the pilot light going, but as it turned out we could not get the fireplace to work.  Matthew said they would have to get a gas fitter in.  Too bad. It would have been nice to have the fireplace going as we were for the end of Dec. The doors were squeaky and in need of a good spray of WD40.",

Felt very cozy, spacious, cute decorations, very clean, and quick responses from owner. Highly recommend and will stay again. Recommend bring ear plugs as the walls can be a bit thin sometimes and weekends can get noisy with other visitors in the building.",

Condo has a warm, like being at home feeling and has all the amenities you need to be at home away from home. Right on the edge of town, so close to enjoy all that Fernie has to offer as well.  Matt was quick to respond to any of my questions, and made it super simple to book and have all the information you need for arrival.  Will be booking this place again for sure.",

          "comment": "Perfect condo for a small family or two couples! Location is highly accessible from the highway and yet still very close to downtown.  Matthew was extremely accommodating and quick to respond to any and all of our inquiries. Ample parking for vehicles, less so for trailers but still very manageable. Due to COVID-19 we were unable to use the pool or hot tub but we did take a peek at it and it looks nice and inviting. Good amenities (i.e. coffee pot, washer/dryer, fast-boil kettle, natural gas fireplace, BBQ, local soaps in the bathrooms, etc.), with the exception of glassware, so I'd recommend brining along some red solo cups. There is a beautiful little hike about a 5 minute drive called Fairy Creek Falls - I highly recommend this for a short jaunt in nature if time permits! Overall I'd recommend a stay here if you ever find yourself in Fernie!",

If you are planning to do your own cooking, you'll need to bring everything for cooking. Spices, oils, sugar, coffee, tea. I've never stayed at an airbnb that didn't have a little welcome package with a few items to start your first morning. Even hotels give you coffee! Hopefully the host will look into the very squeeky bed! It's been mentioned a few times in the reviews. Lastly, communication is very prompt and efficient. It's too bad the amenities were closed due to covid.",

Great location (short up hill walk to the lifts, but very manageable), so comfortable and clean.   We had one small issue with the ski locker, but Brian fixed it right away.  Everything else about our stay was perfect.  We especially loved the large seating area in the living room, and all the little touches (salt and pepper, Saran Wrap, cooking oil, very well equipped kitchen).  Thanks again for a great stay!",

The unit is on the main floor so it made for easy loading and unloading of our gear. The building was quiet and the space was perfect for our little family. The living room was cozy with the fireplace and the bathroom had a deep tub to soak in. We loved the local all-natural body and hand soaps available for use. Kevin was a pleasure to communicate with, quick to respond and checked in from time to time to make sure we had everything we needed. We would definitely come back next time we are in the area.",

It was a pleasure to spend a few days relaxing after skiing and enjoying that spectacular view of the ski hill from the living room. We were okay with not having an elevator to get to the condo as we are active people. You can look forward to a pleasant stay and comfortable good night’s sleep as the beds and bedding were top notch. Thank you again Jennifer. We hope to stay at your condo again in the future.",

          "comment": "We booked this to celebrate my nephew's 12th birthday. The space was great. The upstairs level had a nice fireplace and the bedrooms and bathrooms were large and comfortable. The downstairs level had another full size bathroom as well as another bedroom. The entertainment space was immense, with a massive couch that we all lounged on and played games. It was great having the smart TV's upstairs and downstairs, as it allowed us to easily put on some movies. Lots of parking and the location to Fernie itself was nice. A gas station was nearby as well as a number of restaurants and playgrounds. The only negative we really had was the bbq wasn't clean and we couldn't find anything to clean it with. Otherwise it was a great spot and one we'd definitely look at staying at again.",

And we decided to stay in this place because of better pictures and that we assumed there will be all the necessary cutlery, but there is nothing. Only microwave and empty boxes. My mistake that I didn't contact the host before booking and asked if they had any cutlery and kettle in the room, but I assumed that if they have a microwave and cutlery cabinet in the pictures they must have everything inside. Anyway, I want to leave this review for other people who might make the same assumption. There are no cutlery, kettle, or anything else except microwave, soap in the bathroom, towels, and TV",

I've stayed in other suites in this same complex and my general consensus is the rooms run warm so you will be toasty warm. The yard lights are a bit bright so bring a eye mask if you need pitch black to sleep. But location to the ski hill, cleanliness and price are totally worth it. I'd stay again!",

Great value and stay overall, I hope to be back!",

It is a well appointed 2br/2ba condo that was five minutes from the slopes. \n\nWe cooked and the kitchen is well equipped...and we even did our dirty laundry before packing up and heading home. \n\nDue to COVID, the hot tubs we closed which was disappointing, but we get it. Don’t hesitate to stay with these lovely people in their lovely rental unit.",

Great touches like games, and a nice welcome note from the owners on arrival. Private entrance/exit off patio provided a good alternative to the main door and hallway during covid. Although the hallway was always quiet. Nice building, not too noisy. Location is really good for skiing Fernie. Short walk or drive to the base area. We loved skiing Fernie, lots of harder terrain for the adults and great beginners area for our kid.",

Great location with easy walking distance to Fernie downtown and a short drive to the slopes. \n\nOnly downside we found is that as the suite is attached to the main house there was a lot of loud house chatter and strong smells from the kitchen (separated by just a door) which seemed to linger in the suite. We did mention to the host and the noise level improved, just don't expect ideal conditions for relaxing in your room.",

Location is good, quick drive to the ski hill or walk to downtown. Heated floor in the bathroom is a treat! Plenty of room to dry wet ski clothes. Cooking facilities are limited with just a microwave, small fridge and kettle. We were woken up once by noises from upstairs, but we were expecting to be living beneath people so sounds and cooking smells did not bother us too much.",

Our host also offered to replace it promptly but as I said not a big issue. Outside of that it does have an open loft so if you are trying to get someone to sleep up there whilst activities carry on in the evening and or you are getting up early in the morning and are trying to get stuff done in kitchen without waking anyone else up the open concept could be a problem but was not an issue for our group.  Good location, good accommodations & our host Paul was very thorough and responsive.",

The two rooms on the main floor are nice and dark which is great for little ones. The upper loft gets more sunlight as it is a loft. There are some dark room dividers that can help a bit with that during longer summer days. All rooms and loft have ceiling fans and the A/C makes for a comfortable stay. Kitchen well stocked. Excellent communication. Overall, a very good stay.",

Room has a microwave and fridge, and there is access to the BBQ area, so possible to cook a few meals despite not having a full kitchen. You will need to bring any plates/utensils/cups however as this is not provided by the host. Fan/fridge a bit loud at night. Farah was quick to answer any of our questions via the app. Hot tubs are in the building but closed due to covid sadly. \n\nWill definitely be back next time we are in Fernie! Thanks again for a great, affordable stay!",

Everything was provided that one could need and it was a great home away from home. The smart TV was an incredible surprise, and it was a super quick walk to the ski hill. Literally took 13 minutes to walk up, get lift passes and walk back. We will be back for sure, summer or winter!",

The place was better than we expected - so many lovely things. It was very clean - which feels so important these days! Beer and cookies waiting for us upon arriva! Condo layout is very nice, everything that you need is there, bed was comfortable, views out the windows were great, ground floor patio was awesome to relax on after biking, communal green space great to find a sunny spot for morning coffee. Hosts were very responsive - checking to make sure we had everything we needed. All around just wonderful! Thank you and we will be back!",

Imagine after a day of exploring a rec & cultural meca, finishing your day wrapped in plush robes w/wine, cozy lighting-in & out, all in complete privacy. You have your own small private cabin with outdoor hottub, camp fire pit & a treehouse. Enjoy bike & ski storage, indoor fireplace, bathroom, laundry & full kitchen. Steps away from a multi-use rec trail, lake beach fronts year round adventure from summer swimming to the Winter Whiteway!<br><br>Once you pick up your keys, you’re on your own. This space is special. Its 270 sq feet of pure relaxation with everything you will ever need for an amazing stay. It’s time to disconnect & clear your mind, body, spirit & soul. There’s parking for 2 vehicles & 1 RV. A 30ft RV is available for rent. All firewood & kindling or fire starter is included.<br><br>The cabin itself & the surrounding field are all for our guests; & our guests alone. Guests will have to share with local wildlife, however. We may access our forestry equipment from time to time in the far corner of the upper field; we try to communicate this to our guests prior to. With improvements, the cabin field will get its own fence, giving guests 100% privacy 100% of the time.<br><br>We love to socialize with our guests or completely leave them alone in privacy. We are available anytime to our guests by phone, text, message, email & we encourage our guests to communicate with us for anything they may need or need help with during their stay. We want each guest to have the best experience possible!<br><br>Privacy best describes this space. Situated just on the outskirts of town, yet a 5 min drive to downtown Invermere, everything is close, yet far away. We are right at the start of a multi-use Rec trail that is paved & spans from Invermere to Fairmont. The private outdoor hottub & shower are incredible with a full view of the Purcell Mountains all while surrounded by trees & nature on your own 2 acre parcel. Neighboring houses are each 3 acre parcels.<br><br>We are so close to the Invermere side of the Legacy Recreation Trail (25km Invermere to Fairmont) that once you are parked at your little red cabin this trail can be accessed by walking or biking(750meters) Turning north rather than south (Fairmont) is a handy sidewalk that takes you right into downtown Invermere.<br><br>We have an almost 2 year old male yellow lab teenage dog named Bailey who is very friendly. We try to keep his visits to our guests at a minimum. Please let us know if he is a bother :-)",

The hot tub was amazing after a day of hiking, the tree house was fantastic for the kids, and watching the deer in the early morning from the bed was magical. We will definitely be back!",

Everything is perfectly planned - so much so that a sudden change in COVID-19 restrictions, which affected our dinner reservations, had hardly any impact because we were just as comfortable staying in a making dinner in the cabin. I hope we are able to make it back again!",

Both the indoor as well as the outdoor spaces are absolutely perfect. I've been to many Airbnb's in my life, and this one is my favorite. I cannot speak highly enough of the personalized touches Ellen ensures are complete for each stay. We had a bonfire 2 nights, used the hot tub at least once a day, and tried to stop time to bask in that view!!! This place is exceptional, the host is exceptional & is truly one of the most generous thoughtful people. Heaven on earth. If i could give more stars I would.",

Every little detail had been thought of, it was immaculately clean, the sheer comfort and care put in to everything was incredible. I've never seen so much packed in to such a tiny little spot. We were absolutely moved by this place, it is truly unique and special. Ellen was absolutely incredible, she was made to host, she graciously answered my numerous questions and offered so many tips and suggestions on what to do and places to go including an absolutely breathtaking view point nearby that we never would have found without her telling us. I think this place will be successful for years to come and probably consistently booked out due to popularity. We are already planning a summer trip! Thank you so much Ellen and Greg for an amazing time!!!",

Everything you could possibly need has been thoughtfully organized and prepared.  We were lucky enough to meet the dog, who came down to greet us and is very friendly! We even had a bunch of deer come by!  I'd definitely recommend taking the drive to Panorama, pull over where you see lookouts and check out some of the amazing views!

There was sheltered parking and the communication leading up to check-in was very quick and accurate. The place was very clean and well furnished with enough space to store/dry ski gear. The puppy was super cute and friendly as well! Tom was a great host, provided recommendations for places in town and made sure we had everything we needed. Would definitely recommend!",
